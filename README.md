Life poem

按照你的心脏和直觉, and intuition, 
这应该是, your number one mission. 
倾听 to your inner voice, 
住你的生活, through your choice.

关键是要爱, what you are doing, 
你最深的激情; should be pursuing. 
每一刻, live excited, 
每一天早晨, be delighted.

总是期待, to what is ahead, 
你的思想和智慧, gracefully spread. 
居住生活发挥到淋漓尽致, is up to you, 
照照镜子, always be true.
